        <h3>Hi! Hello! What's Up?</h3>
          <p> My name is Dylan Armstead and I am a software development student. When I am not focusing on my education, I am a QA Analyst working in Escondido, CA in San Diego county. My time working in Product Development has inspired me to move from testing and breaking others' code to doing the same with my own. </p>
        </div>

        <h3>When it comes to software...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I am currently in a Software Engineering program right now to pursue a career in the field.</li>
          <li>Working in QA now, I test good and bad code all of the time, so I am remaining cognizant of my own habits as I get started.</li>
          <li>Once I finish the program, I hope to pursue a development position in the fields of: crowdfunding, movie/tv media, or video game development.</li>         
        </ul>

        <h3>A bit more about me...</h3>
          <p>My former background and formal education are not in technical fields; shout outs to my fellow PR and Sociology Majors. While my educational pursuits instilled senses of strong communication and social awareness, my hobbies have always leaned towards personal puzzle-solving and group achievement. I believe in the work hard, play hard attitude; so you will find me headsdown when there is work to be done and enjoying any well-deserved time offline. General interests of mine would include video games, snowboarding, whiskey(s), movies and tv, and spending time with my friends, family and fianceè.</p>
